# aws-static-website-s3-cloudfront
This project demonstrates the deployment of a static website using Amazon S3 for storage and Amazon CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast, secure, and scalable distribution. I configured an S3 bucket to host static web content, set appropriate bucket policies for secure access, and integrated CloudFront.
